 * Schema interpreter and "hyper/media-link" agent interface.

 * This type of class makes it possible to read a json-schema and load the links that are defined in it. (e.g. "follow" the links, a fetch/alter the linked resource)
 * Makes it easy to use the links defined in json-schemas as outlined in the JSON-Schema Hyper schema extension.
